<Leader>p

Turn a line consisting of expressions separated by commas into a printf
statement. A expression is recognized as a sequence of any characters expect
for whitespace and comma. Examples showing the line before and after
invoking '<Leader>p':

  Before       After
  x            printf("x=%d\n", x);
  x, x/y       printf("x=%d, x/y=%d\n", x, x/y);
  sizeof(x)    printf("sizeof(x)=%d\n", sizeof(x));

The command assumes that every expression is an integer expression.
Deducting the correct type is too complex. However the cursor is moved to
the first directive (%) which allows for modification of the conversion
specifier.  Pressing ';' repeatedly in normal mode will therefore move the
cursor to the next directive.

b:printf_pattern

Pattern used to construct the printf statement, defaults to:

  printf("%d\n", %s);

The pattern must include exactly two substitution directives, where the
first will be used as the directive in the formatted string and later
substituted with the formatted string. The second will be substituted with
the expressions. Examples using different patterns before and after invoking
'<Leader>p':

Pattern               Before    After
printf("%d\n", %s)    x         printf("x=%d\n", x)
printf("%s\n", %s)    x         printf("x=%s\n", x)
